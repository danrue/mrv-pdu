COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE SPECIFICATIONS,

However, in the event of a Product Defect, if Purchaser provides 
MRV Communications with written notice of such Product Defect 
(as well as with the model and serial number of that Product for 
validation purposes) within the applicable period specified 
below,  MRV Communications warrants that it will repair the 
Product Defect at no charge, replace the defective Product at no 
charge, or refund the net purchase price paid by Purchaser for 
the defective unit of Product.  This shall be Purchaser’s sole and 
exclusive remedy, in contract and at law, regarding that Product, 
and such warranty is non-transferable.
	a. Hardware - A Product Defect shall mean a defect in
Product materials and workmanship under normal use and service,
or a material failure of the Product to perform substantially in
accordance with the applicable Product specification in a standard
configuration environment, which is reported within three (3) years 
for an LX Series Product), one (1) year (for all MRV Series 
Products) or thirty (30) days (for newly sold, refurbished Products), 
of the date it was first shipped by MRV to Purchaser, provided that 
such failure is not due to any faulty installation of the Product. 
MRV shall have the option, but not an obligation, to repair, 
replace or grant a refund with regard to the repaired or replaced 
Product during the remainder of that same period. If Purchaser is 
provided with replacement Product prior to Purchaser's return to 
MRV of the allegedly defective Product, MRV reserves the right 
to invoice Purchaser for the replacement Product (and Purchaser 
agrees to pay in accordance with the requirements of that invoice) 
if the Product being replaced is not returned to MRV, freight 
prepaid, within thirty (30) days of Purchaser's receipt of the 
replacement Product.
	b.  Software or Firmware - A Product Defect shall 
mean a defect in the media itself, which is reported to MRV Communications 
by Purchaser within ninety (90) days from the date it 
was first shipped by MRV Communications to Purchaser.  MRV Communications 
shall have the option, but not an obligation, to repair, replace or 
grant a refund with regard to the repaired or replaced Product during 
the remainder of that same period.
	c.  Services - MRV Communications’ responsibility and 
liability for any defective Service(s) is solely as set forth in the 
applicable MRV Communications Support Agreements.  To the 
extent MRV provides any Services without charge, such 
Services shall be supplied on an AS-IS basis only, and MRV 
shall bear no responsibility or liability for such Services.
8.  Responsibility - MRV Communications’ responsibility for 
repairing, replacing or refunding the net purchase price paid by 
Purchaser for Products with Product Defects applies only to 
Product Defects present when shipped by MRV.  Accordingly, 
and for example, MRV Communications is not responsible for repairing, 
replacing or refunding the purchase price paid for Products with 
Product Defects arising out of any accident, abuse, 
misapplication, alteration, attached equipment, improper 
handling or installation, improper operation, operation outside 
of the environmental specifications for the Products, or any 
other cause outside of MRV Communications’ control.

9.  Infringement - MRV Communications retains the exclusive right 
to defend Purchaser against any claim(s) based on an MRV Communications 
Product (excluding Third Party Product content) infringing a patent 
or a copyright.  If Purchaser provides MRV Communications with prompt 
written notice of a claim(s) or any threat of such a claim(s), and 
provided that Purchaser gives MRV Communications all assistance required 
in connection with such defense and Purchaser is not in breach of 
its obligations hereunder, MRV Communications will pay all damages finally 
awarded.  However, MRV Communications may, at its option, settle any such 
claim(s), purchase a license under the allegedly infringed patent 
or copyright, replace or modify the Product to avoid the 
infringement asserted, or grant Purchaser a refund or credit not 
to exceed the purchase price paid by Purchaser for the infringing 
unit(s) of Product.  Subject to Paragraph 10 below, MRV Communications' 
responsibility or liability with regard to infringement 
claim(s) shall apply only to the infringement of a patent or a 
copyright by the unmodified MRV Communications Product on a 
standalone basis.  Accordingly, and for example, MRV Communications 
shall have no responsibility or liability for any intellectual 
property infringement claim(s) arising out of the combination, 
operation or use of any MRV Communications Product(s) with hardware, 
software or firmware not owned or licensed by MRV Communications hereunder.

10.  Third Party Products - To the extent any Product includes 
hardware, software or firmware purchased or licensed by MRV Communications 
from a third party (Third Party Products), Purchaser’s right to use 
such third party content shall be subject to the terms and conditions
packaged with such contents.  MRV Communications’ only responsibility and 
liability for any Third Party Products shall be limited to passing 
through whatever warranty protections, support, licensing and 
indemnification protections it is entitled to pass through to 
Purchaser.

11.  License - Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 10 above, 
MRV Communications grants Purchaser a non-transferable, non-
exclusive personal license to use the MRV Communications Software 
at a Purchaser facility which is owned and controlled by 
Purchaser, solely to communicate to MRV Communications 
Hardware at that same facility for Purchaser’s own end-use 
purposes at such facilities.  Such end-use specifically excludes any 
right to, and Purchaser agrees not to (i) decompile, reverse 
compile, disassemble, reverse engineer or perform any other 
activity which has as its purpose or otherwise results in the 
derivation of MRV Communications Software source code; (ii) copy 
except as authorized in Paragraph 13 below; (iii)  modify; or (iv) 
transfer, the MRV Communications Software and/or any documentation 
associated therewith.  This license will terminate if, as, and when 
Purchaser fails to comply with any term or condition of this Agreement.

12.  Indemnification - Purchaser agrees to indemnify and 
hereby holds MRV Communications harmless from any liabilities, 
claims, or damages, in contract and at law, arising out of any (i)

any use of a Product), or (ii) MRV Communications’ compliance with 
Purchaser’s instructions, specifications or requirements.

of any assignee for the benefit of creditors or of a receiver,

payment of any invoices then outstanding and to cancel any 
unfilled part of any outstanding Purchase Order issued by 
Purchaser, without liability or penalty.

17.  Overshipment or Undershipment - Purchaser shall be 
obligated and agrees to promptly pay for all Products in
